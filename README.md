Hey I'm Vance, I am a software developer with a couple years dedicated to data analytics. I come from a background in environment science but am transitioning into a more technical focused role. I find the work truly fascinating and found a true passion for working in web-based architectures. My diverse background shows I am adaptable and I bring with me a few key insights to working with and supporting data driven products.
